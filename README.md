I’m a Web & App Developer and Creative Technologist with a background in computer information systems.
I enjoy building projects that combine design, technology, and creativity, from websites and mobile apps to interactive and smart systems.
Always exploring new tools, ideas, and ways to make things work beautifully across digital and physical spaces.
